Input to this Project is the interconnectfile file generated by Intel Quartus.
We are modifying this file with the help of routers which are using cross-bar switches to prevent attacks.
This Repo has 3 main scripts related to router obfuscations.

1.json_creator.py → Used to create list of routers to be obfuscated.
2.router_output_gen.py → Writes obfuscated logic into a text file
3.noc_top_clean.py → Creates new interconnectfile with obfuscated design

Steps:-
1. Create a JSON file by a random selection of routers.
   Running "json_creator.py" lists all the routers in the interconnect file (project1_demo_altera_mm_interconnect_1920_w6invni.v) and prints the routers in the JSON Format.
2. "router_output_gen.py" takes the input from the json file "router.json". The routers from the json are obfuscated.
    The command is "python router_output_gen.py > output_cb.txt"
3. "noc_top_clean.py" creates the file "project1_demo_altera_mm_interconnect_1920_w6invni_new.v" with the obfuscated router implementation.
The file can be elaborated with a few minor corrections for reference.


This repo has many other scripts which are used for custom purposes
